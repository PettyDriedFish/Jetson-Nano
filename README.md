Record various situations of the project!

I have been learning Jeston Nano for a few days and have encountered some issues. Suddenly, I want to record the entire project!

I tried to burn the SD card and the entire process went very smoothly! I haven't even seen a system pop-up. But after telling me that the burn was successful, I found that countless disks appeared. I was very shocked. At present, I suspect that this issue may occur due to not being an official package.

Another domestically produced burning process information: https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_67660471/article/details/127693072

The domestic nano and NVIDIA nano have an additional step of firmware flushing, and the image file is different. Other operations are basically the same.
